VennPlot
========

This is a Java program for drawing rotationally symmetric Venn diagrams that are simple and monotone. 
Any closed curve divides the plane into two regions : the interior of the curve and the exterior of the curve. 
With a collection of n curves therefore, we can have up to 2<sup>n</sup> different regions. 
An n-Venn diagram is defined as a collection of n closed curves containing exactly 2<sup>n</sup> regions where each region is 
in the interior of a unique subset of the curves. Rotationally symmetric Venn diagrams exist only if the number of curves is prime [1].

Labelling the curves of an n-Venn diagram from 1 to n, we associate a binary number r to each region, called the rank of the region, 
where the i-th bit is 1 if curve number i contains the region, otherwise it is 0. The number of curves containing a region, 
which is the same as the number of 1's in the rank of the region, is called the weight of the region.

A Venn diagram is simple if no more than two curves intersect at any given point. A monotone Venn digram is the one in 
which any region of weight k is adjacent to at least one region of weight k + 1 and is also adjacent to at least one 
region of weight k-1.

A rotationally symmetric Venn diagram consists of n congruent pie slices. A pie slice of a simple symmetric monotone Venn 
diagram of n curves can be represented by a binary matrix of n-1 rows and (2<sup>n</sup> - 2)/n columns such that each 
column contains exactly one 1 and no two 1's are adjacent in a row. The 1's in the matrix represent the points at which 
the curves intersect. Similarly, it can be represented by a sequence of length (2<sup>n</sup> -2)/n of integers in 
range [0, n-2] which is called the crossing sequence. The i-th element indicates the row number of the matrix which 
contains a 1 at column i. 

For example the famous three circle Venn diagram can be represented by the following binary matrix and crossing sequence.

The crossing sequence of some simple symmetric Venn diagram with different number of curves, including the first
simple syymetric 11-Venn diagram named Newroz [2], are available under directory InputData. 

Given the crossing sequence of a simple symmetric n-Venn diagram as input, this program creates an SVG file of the Venn diagram.

The program takes 5 arguments as input which are :

1. n : The number of curves
2. input-file-name : The name of the file containing the crossing sequences.
This file contains the crossing sequence of the Venn diagrams we want to draw.
Each diagram is given as a sequence of (2^n-2)/n integers in range [0, n-2] and separated by a space.
3. colours-file-name : The name of the file containing the codes of filling/stroke colours.
This files contains an integer n as the number of colours followed by n colour codes in hexadecimal format, for example, #FF0000 for the red colour.
4. filling-mode : Indicates the filling style. 1 : filled, 0 : not-filled.
5. drawing-mode : Indicates the style of drawing. 0 : Radial, 1 : Cylindrical.


Below are two example diagrams drawn by the program.

#### How to draw the diagrams:
To draw the Venn diagrams, you first need to compile the java code:

```java
javac VennPlot.java</code>
```

Then draw the Venn diagrams using appropriate Crossing sequence and color-code files.
For example, running the program with the following arguments, draws all 23 simple symmetric monotone 7-Venn diagrams 
(See [3] for more information about generating Venn diagrams).

```java
java VennPlot 7 ./InputData/CrossingSequences/VennSeven.txt ./InputData/ColorCodes/SevenColors.txt 1 0
```
